# netcat-rs

`netcat` implemented in Rust.

I love `netcat` (often aliased as `nc`). I wanted to write it in Rust. Here we are.

I might go ahead and write some Rust implementations of other common Unix utilities
in the future.

Currently we only support an outgoing and incoming (`-l`) connection.

## TODO

* Add IPv6 support
* Better error handling
